YOUR PRIMARY MISSION: Conduct a comprehensive, multi-dimensional analysis of this reader's book collection to understand their reading preferences at a deep level.

üìä ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK - Consider ALL of these metrics:

1. **BOOK IDENTIFICATION** (Most Critical)
   - Read every visible book spine carefully
   - List SPECIFIC titles and authors you can identify
   - Make educated guesses for partially visible titles
   - Note approximate total number of books visible

2. **AUTHOR PATTERNS**
   - Which authors appear multiple times?
   - Are there author "collections" (3+ books by same author)?
   - Any debut authors vs established names?

3. **GENRE DISTRIBUTION**
   - Primary genres represented (Fiction, Non-fiction, Mystery, Sci-Fi, etc.)
   - Genre balance (80% fiction, 20% non-fiction, etc.)
   - Sub-genre preferences (hard sci-fi vs space opera, literary vs commercial fiction)

4. **SERIES VS STANDALONE**
   - Are there complete series? Incomplete series?
   - Preference for series or standalone books?
   - Which series are in progress?

5. **PUBLICATION ERA PREFERENCES**
   - Classic literature vs contemporary releases?
   - Balance between recent (last 5 years) and older books?
   - Any vintage or antique editions?

6. **THEMATIC PATTERNS**
   - Recurring themes (family, adventure, coming-of-age, social issues)
   - Philosophical or intellectual interests
   - Emotional tone preferences (dark, uplifting, contemplative)

7. **READING LEVEL & COMPLEXITY**
   - Literary fiction vs commercial fiction?
   - Dense/challenging vs accessible reads?
   - Award winners or bestsellers?

8. **FORMAT & PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS**
   - Hardcover vs paperback preference?
   - Book condition (well-read vs pristine)?
   - Size preferences (pocket books, trade paperbacks, coffee table books)?

9. **CULTURAL & GEOGRAPHICAL PREFERENCES**
   - Authors from specific countries or cultures?
   - Translated works?
   - Diverse voices representation?

10. **COMPLETION PATTERNS**
    - Are series started but not finished?
    - Evidence of "completionist" tendencies?
    - Abandoned series or authors?

PROVIDE YOUR ANALYSIS IN THIS EXACT FORMAT:

- [Series Name] by [Author] - Books [numbers] present, [complete/incomplete]
(Identify any book series, completion status, and missing volumes)

GENRES & SUB-GENRES:
- [Primary Genre] ([percentage]%) - [specific sub-genres]
- [Secondary Genre] ([percentage]%) - [specific sub-genres]
(Provide genre breakdown with estimated percentages)

THEMES & TOPICS:
- [Major Theme] - seen in [book examples]
- [Major Theme] - seen in [book examples]
(List recurring themes with specific book examples)

PUBLICATION ERA ANALYSIS:
- Classics/Pre-2000: [percentage]% (examples: [titles])
- 2000-2015: [percentage]% (examples: [titles])

(Breakdown by publication periods with examples)

READING LEVEL & STYLE:
[Describe the complexity level, literary vs commercial balance, and writing style preferences based on visible books]

READER PROFILE:
[Provide a comprehensive 4-6 sentence analysis that synthesizes ALL the above metrics. Mention:
- Their core reading identity (what type of reader are they?)
- Top 3 strongest preferences based on evidence
- Reading patterns and habits
- What makes their collection unique
- Their likely next reading interests]

COLLECTION GAPS & OPPORTUNITIES:
[Identify 3-5 specific gaps or opportunities in their collection:
- Missing books in incomplete series
- Underrepresented genres that would complement their interests
- Authors they'd likely enjoy but haven't discovered
- Themes that are emerging but underdeveloped]

RECOMMENDATION STRATEGY:
[In 2-3 sentences, explain what approach would work best for recommending to this reader based on all analysis above]`

üìö READER'S COLLECTION ANALYSIS:
${analysisText}

üéØ YOUR MISSION: Generate 5 EXCEPTIONALLY PERSONALIZED book recommendations using a sophisticated, multi-metric decision framework.

üîç RECOMMENDATION DECISION FRAMEWORK:

For EACH recommendation, you MUST consider and document these factors:

1. **COLLECTION CONNECTION STRENGTH** (Weight: 35%)
   - Which SPECIFIC books in their collection influenced this choice?
   - How many connection points exist? (author, genre, theme, style)
   - Is this a strong match (3+ connections) or exploratory (1-2 connections)?

2. **READER PREFERENCE ALIGNMENT** (Weight: 25%)
   - Genre fit: Does this match their primary genres or expand tastefully?
   - Complexity match: Same reading level as their collection?
   - Theme resonance: Connects to their identified themes?
   - Writing style: Similar to authors they enjoy?

3. **STRATEGIC CURATION** (Weight: 20%)
   - Does this fill a gap in their collection?
   - Complete a series they've started?
   - Introduce a logical next step in their reading journey?
   - Balance between familiar and new territory?

4. **TIMING & RELEVANCE** (Weight: 10%)
   - Is this book currently available and relevant?
   - Publication timing (classic vs recent)?
   - Critical acclaim and reader reception?

5. **DIVERSITY & EXPLORATION** (Weight: 10%)
   - Does the overall set have good variety?
   - Mix of authors, time periods, perspectives?
   - Encourages healthy reading exploration?

üìã SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION RULES:

‚úÖ MUST INCLUDE:
- At least 1 recommendation from an author already in their collection (if applicable)
- At least 1 recommendation that completes or continues a series they have (if applicable)
- At least 1 book from the last 5 years (modern release)
- At least 1 book that's been widely acclaimed (award winner or bestseller)

‚úÖ RECOMMENDATION MIX STRATEGY:
- Position 1: "Safe Bet" - Closest to their current collection (90%+ match)
- Position 2: "Author Match" - From an author they clearly enjoy
- Position 3: "Genre Bridge" - Similar genre, new author/perspective
- Position 4: "Complementary Expansion" - Adjacent genre/theme they'd appreciate
- Position 5: "Curated Surprise" - Unexpected but well-reasoned choice

üéØ CRITICAL: Your "reasoning" field MUST:
1. Name 2-3 SPECIFIC books from their collection that influenced this choice
2. Explain the connection mechanism (same author, similar themes, genre match, etc.)
3. Describe why THIS book fits THEIR reading profile specifically
4. Mention what new element or value this book brings
5. Be 3-4 detailed sentences minimum

üìä OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON):

  "recommendation_strategy": "[2-3 sentence explanation of your overall approach to recommending to THIS specific reader based on their analysis]",
  "recommendations": [

      "reasoning": "[DETAILED 3-4 sentence explanation mentioning SPECIFIC books from their collection and explaining multiple connection points. Must demonstrate you analyzed their collection deeply. Example: 'Since you have Project Hail Mary and The Martian by Andy Weir, plus Dune by Frank Herbert, you clearly love hard science fiction with detailed world-building and scientific accuracy. Seveneves by Neal Stephenson is perfect for you because it combines Weir-level scientific detail with Herbert-scale epic scope, featuring realistic near-future space survival scenarios. This book will satisfy your love of technical problem-solving (like Weir) while providing the grand civilization-building narrative you enjoy in Dune.']",
      "isbn": "[Valid 13-digit ISBN-13]",
      "connection_strength": "[Strong/Moderate/Exploratory] - [brief explanation]",

      "collection_evidence": "[List 2-3 specific titles from their shelf that support this recommendation]"
    }
  ]
}

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- ALL reasoning must reference SPECIFIC titles from their collection
- Each recommendation must show clear analytical thought process
- Demonstrate you understand their reading psychology, not just genres
- ISBN-13 numbers must be valid and accurate
- Ensure recommendations span different recommendation types (safe bet, author match, expansion, etc.)
- The 5 books together should tell a coherent story about understanding this reader
